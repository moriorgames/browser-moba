- MapController: The edit action is creating a new entity, I need to modify the current entity.
- The :map/edit.html.twig needs to change the literal to "edit map" instead of "new map"
- Create the delete action over the list "map_index" with an alert.
- ArchetypeController: File management and the creation of the CRUD
